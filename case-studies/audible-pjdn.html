                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

                     <p> Promoting Audible's Kurupt FM 'Podkast'with websites designed for Chabuddy G’s (from comedy People Just Do Nothing) 'upstanding' businesses.</p>
                      
                     <p> Audible challenged us to drive as many conversions to podcast downloads as possible while relaying the message that Audible is a creator of high-quality original content. The target audience was people aged 16-40 with a focus on existing Kurupt FM fans who were probably unaware that their favourite pirate radio station now had a new home on Audible to promote Audible's new Kurupt FM 'Podkast'.</p>
                      
                     <p> We created 6 websites for Chabuddy G’s (from comedy People Just Do Nothing) businesses. They were art directed just as if Chabuddy G had designed them himself, so pretty shoddy. That's why each website contained a radio/video ad with gifs, jpegs and web counters straight from 1998. Clickable links sent the visitor to the Audible Kurupt FMwebpage, often via a “420 page not found” screen. These websites were shared directly to fans on social mediaby Chabuddy G himself.</p>
                      
                     <h3> Context</h3>
                      
                     <p> Chabuddy G is Kurupt FM’s manager from comedy People Just Do Nothing. He ‘sponsored’ the podcasts with a number of his business ventures via a series of audio ads. We took this further by creating websites in the style of Chabuddy G’s aesthetic (cheap & dated). Each website drove to the Audible site, allowing fans to make the association between high quality content they were familiar with and Audible.</p>
                      
                    <h3>  Results:</h3>
                    <p>  The Kurupt Websites campaign led to the Kurupt FM podcast being the most downloaded Audible podcast that month.</p>
                      
                    <h3> Design and build</h3>
                      
                    <p>  The brief was to make 6 microsites which promoted each podcast.  Content for this project were created with the Kurupt FM team and Recipe, this included jingles, audio clips and videos. The Kurupt team had recorded their 6 'podkast' episodes and had a featured landingpage on Audible.co.uk which was to be used as the click-out for each site.</p>
                      
                    <p>  With direction from the creative team at Recipe Advertising, I set about sourcing 90s gifs and awful geocities style bad web design for inspiration. The process of briefing a developer on the subtle nuances I wanted to capture the poor web experience we endured in the 90s was going to be a lot of work, so in the spirit of Chabuddy G I just made the websites myself in CSS and Javascript and mainly designed in the browser. Needless to say, as a UX designer this was the antithesis of what I am used to in my day-to-day, but I don't think I have ever spent a project laughing at what I was making.</p>
                      
                    <p>  One of the main challenges I encountered during this project was how to make a 90s website work to todays web standards - I use the term 'standards' loosely, as we had auto-play audio on most of the sites and deliberate SSL errors. Getting these sites to work on mobile was tricky, as the traffic would be coming from social, it was imperative to get a decent mWeb experience</p>
                      
                    <p>  The sites feature many hidden easter eggs, including ascii graffiti hidden in the markup, custom ugly domains, fake SSL certificates (deliberately insecure protocols), usable search from a 1998 version of google, custom scrollbars (they took me ages so felt the need to mention). As well as interactive elements such as an error message that seemingly crashes your computer, and a fully working Ouija board where you can contact Steve's nan.</p>
                      
                    <p>  HEADPHONE WARNING: These sites use auto-play audio and may be very loud.</p>
